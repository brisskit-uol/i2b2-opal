#i2b2 to opal integration

##Overview
The idea here is to hook up i2b2 and opal so that data can be automatically exported from i2b2 and imported into opal.

##Prerequisits
This uses the core opal python to put stuff in opal, specifically the rest commands. This needs to be installed prior to running this. See http://wiki.obiba.org/display/OPALDOC/Opal+Python+User+Guide for installation notes and other info.

##Misc
There is no notion of updating data with this - it has to be completely dropped and reimported. It ought to be possible to make it do updates to stuff in opal, but this needs some work.
